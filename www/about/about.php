<p><font size='5'>The Palmer Ridge Robotics Team (a.k.a. Bearbotics) represents Lewis Palmer School District #38 to FRC - the FIRST Robotics Competition. 
Anyone and everyone in the district is welcome to join. Every year we are presented with a challenge from FIRST to design, build, and program a 
robot from scratch to complete a specific task. We don't know what the task will be until "Kick-off" in January when the game is announced. 
The challenge is usually to manipulate game pieces along with your team mates (robots created by other teams) to score more points than the other 
team. Last year our task was to build a robot that could move a large ball around the field. Points were awarded for scoring goals, as well as 
making assists, which were basically passing the ball to another robot on your team, and for them to bring it to the goal and score.</font></p>
